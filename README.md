Features

1. Upload & Visualize: Easily upload X-ray images and get a visual preview.

2. Instant Prediction: The app uses a trained deep learning model to make instant predictions on the uploaded images.

3. Feedback System: Users can provide feedback on the predictions, aiding in iterative improvement.

4. Feedback Summary: Users can view a summary of the feedback received for the application.



Live Demo

The application is hosted on Streamlit. Check out the live app here: https://medicalmlapp-mygqbpp338ft7xqbqsixvs.streamlit.app/
